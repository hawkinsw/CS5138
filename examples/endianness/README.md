## Explore Endianness

`gdb` makes it easy to peek at the actual contents of memory at runtime. Looking at the content of memory
where we have stored a number of our choosing makes it vividly obvious the effect that endianness has on
the layout of numbers in memory.

### Compile

`$ make`

### Observe

Here is a set of instructions you can follow to observe the layout of multi-byte numbers in memory
when run on a Little-Endian machine.

If we were debugging on a Big-Endian machine, we would have expected to see
the _big end_ of the constant earlier in memory. However, this is a Little-Endian
machine so we see the _little end_ of the constant earlier in memory.

Fascinating.
