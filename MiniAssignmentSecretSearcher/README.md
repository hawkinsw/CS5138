## Malware Mini Assignment: Secret Searcher

In this assignment you will use your new found network analysis powers to analyze the network behavior of an unknown application named `secretsearcher`. The copy of the malware that your threat intelligence team has isolated is included in this folder. Your team has captured four versions -- one that works on an x86 Linux platform (`secretsearcherl`), one that works on an ARM Linux platform (`secretsearcherla`), one that works on an x86 Windows platform (`secretsearcherw`) and, finally, one that works on an ARM Windows platform (`secretsearcherwa`). I will refer to all four variants as simply `secretsearcher`, but you should always be using the one that is appropriate to your platform.

`secretsearcher` has landed on your network thanks to a zero-day vulnerability. Your threat intelligence analysts have told you that the application performs some type of web search but they couldn't figure out which search engine it uses (Google, Bing, Duck Duck Go, etc.). Nor could they figure out the query that it makes on the search engine.

What your intelligence analysts do know is that the query is a type of [digital canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary) that also has operational effects: it triggers some malicious behavior in the search engine and allows the binary to steal the user's search history and cookies -- information that the binary then uses to harvest saved passwords.

You must get to the bottom of the situation quickly or millions of users will have their TikTok memes [rick-rolled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

### Before you begin ...

Every good scientist needs a lab. Before you begin, make sure that you have your analysis lab configured properly. Follow the instructions online [here](https://github.com/hawkinsw/CS5138/blob/main/NetworkLabConfiguration/LabConfiguration.md).

For the remainder of the document, we will use the same language that we did in the configuration document. We will refer to the lab's VirtualBox-based virtual network simply as the _virtual network_. We will refer to the guest running the Kali distribution of the Linux operating system as the _Kali VM_. We will refer to the guest running either the Ubuntu distribution of the Linux operating system or the Windows operating system as the _analysis VM_ (because it is where you will be doing the malware analysis.)

> Note: The instructions for this Mini Assignment assume that you are using Ubuntu Linux to run your Analysis VM. Obviously that is not a requirement. However, you might have to work through some rough edges. If you are stuck, please, *please* reach out!

### Step 1: Start at the beginning

Throughout the semester our analysis skills have grown sharper. We started by doing some basic static analysis. Then we did some basic dynamic analysis. Most recently, we have learned how to combine dynamic analysis with network analysis. 

When doing analysis, it is always a good idea to try the easiest tools first. Perhaps it is possible to suss out the name of the search engine and the query contents just by looking at the binary statically. If we could do that, our analysis would be much safer (we would never have to execute the potentially malicious program) and quicker (no need to set up a lab environment!).

Using `strings` (or any other tool at your disposal), make and support the claim that we cannot answer the outstanding questions about `secretsearcher` posed in the introduction using only static analysis. Record your response in the `submission.txt` file under Question 1. 

### Step 2: Setting Ourselves Up For Success

We know that `secretsearcher` makes a network connection to a search engine and issues a query. We will assume that the malware author is not naive and that they perform the query over HTTPS and not plain HTTP.

Or maybe not? Again, we should always check the easy things first. 

Let's use Wireshark to validate that the `secretsearcher` malware does its query over HTTPS. How to do that? We will run Wireshark on our Kali VM and run `secretsearcher` on the analysis VM and look at unencrypted HTTP traffic.

Start up the Kali VM and the analysis VM. Use the helper scripts to configure the Kali VM as a router. Make sure that you can access the Internet from the analysis VM. If you need a reminder on how to do any these steps, see the [configuration guide](https://github.com/hawkinsw/CS5138/blob/main/NetworkLabConfiguration/LabConfiguration.md).

On the Kali VM, start up Wireshark and begin monitoring traffic on the network interface attached to the virtual network. Apply a filter so that you only see HTTP traffic. _Hint_: Like we could use `icmp` as a filter for ICMP traffic in Wireshark, we can use `http` as a filter in Wireshark for HTTP traffic. 

Validate that Wireshark, your Kali VM and the analysis VM are all doing "the right thing" by completing this simple test:

1. Open a terminal on the analysis VM and do a `wget` for `cnn.com`: `$ wget http://www.cnn.com`.
2. Verify that Wireshark (on the Kali VM) shows two HTTP packets.

In `submission.txt`, as the response for Question 2, report the [HTTP methods](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231) that are in the two packets *and* the destination IP address of the packet addressed from the analysis VM. 

Now that we know we *can* see HTTP traffic if it exists, let's run `secretsearcher` and see if there is any unencrypted HTTP traffic:

1. Open a terminal on the analysis VM and run `secretsearcher`: 
```console
$ ./secretsearcher
```
2. Verify that Wireshark shows no HTTP packets.

Take a screen shot of Wireshark showing that there was no HTTP traffic generated by the execution of `secretsearcher`. Feel free to annotate the screenshot with labels that will demonstrate you understand the interpretation of Wireshark's output. Record the name of the screenshot under Question 3 in `submission.txt` and be sure to include the image in your submission on Canvas.

### Foiled!

Our job just got significantly harder. We have shown that basic static analysis won't get the job done. We've also show that our first attempt at using network analysis was unhelpful. Looks like we are going to have to turn our analysis [up to 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMSV4OteqBE).

We can deduce that `secretsearcher` is using HTTPS to communicate with the search engine and make its query. Unfortunately, securing HTTP connections with HTTPS means that the contents of the transmissions are secure against prying eyes snooping on the network between the client and the web server.

In order to interfere, we will have to configure our Kali VM to intercept the HTTPS protocol in a way that allows us to inspect the traffic.

Is that possible?

### HTTPS Proxying

YES!! In fact, there are even tools to do it! But, before we get in to the nuts and bolts, let's take a step back and think about what is going on conceptually. In the process, we will refer to a client who is attempting to establish a secure connection with `cnn.com`.

![A conceptual view of an HTTPS connection.](./images/HTTPSConceptualIllustration.png)

HTTPS provides end-to-end security for HTTP connections. In other words, the client (typically a web browser) establishes a secure connection with the web server and all information transmitted over that connection is secure. See the diagram above for a visualization of this type of a connection. 

The client contains a list of Certificate Authorities -- authenticators that they implicitly trust. These Certificate Authorities are big corporate enterprises with strict protocols in place for ensuring that they grant [legitimacy under only the strictest circumstances](https://www.verisign.com/en_US/website-presence/online/ssl-certificates/index.xhtml). When the client connects to a web server it uses that list of authorities to guarantee that the server to which it connected is legitimate. This is the opposite of what we normally think of in authentication. Normally it is the *client* proving to the *server* that they are legitimate. In HTTPS it is the other way around. For a more in-depth introduction to HTTPS, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2GmcPYWm5k) or read the associated [FAQ](https://https.cio.gov/faq/).

Note that in a *real* HTTPS connection there is only one (1) secure handshake -- between the client and the authoritative web server. Based on the description above, we can enumerate the steps in the typical HTTPS connection process:

1. The client connects to `cnn.com`.
2. The web server that is authoritative for `cnn.com` responds.
3. The client checks its Certificate Authorities to ensure that the response was from the legitimate server.
4. The client establishes an HTTPS connection.

![A conceptual view of the components of an HTTPS Proxying setup.](./images/HTTPSProxyConceptualIllustration.png)

Getting around such a scheme is not easy. We'll do it in a series of steps. Before starting, we will install an _impostor_ Certificate Authority on the client server -- one that we control. This will give us the power to prove to the client that a server of our choosing is legitimate for any website. Next, we will configure a type of _proxy server_ that can make HTTPS connections to the Internet. With this configuration, the following is possible:

1. The client attempts to connect to `cnn.com`.
2. The proxy server responds with a guarantee to the client that *it* is the legitimate owner of `cnn.com`. 
3. The client establishes an HTTPS connection *with the proxy server*. This connection is the first of two secure connections (indicated in blue in the figure above). 
4. The proxy server, in turn, connects with the actual `cnn.com` web server. This is the second of two secure connections (indicated in green in the figure above). 
5. During the lifetime of the connection, the proxy server shuffles requests and responses between the client and `cnn.com` transparently. 

Because the client thinks that the proxy server is actually `cnn.com`, the proxy server can decrypt the contents of the client's transmissions. Because `cnn.com` thinks that the proxy server is actually the client, the proxy server can decrypt `cnn.com`'s responses. Just what we wanted -- the ability to see the contents of both the client's and the server's data transmissions in plain text.

> Note: HTTPS proxying has both legitimate and illegitimate uses. Both are oftentimes referred to using the same terminology: a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. For obvious reasons I will try to refrain from using this phrase but it _is_ the name of the software tool that we will use to actually deploy HTTPS Proxying.

### Step 3: Configuring MITM Proxy

MITM Proxy is a tool installed by default in the Kali distribution that allows us to easily perform HTTPS Proxying. The only problem is that the version installed is too old for our purposes. So, we will need to first upgrade the version on our Kali VM. 

Start by downloading the updated version of the program from [mitmproxy.org](https://mitmproxy.org/). Place the downloaded file in the `~Downloads/` directory. 

Untar/zip the file: 

```console
$ tar -xvzf mitmproxy-7.0.4-linux.tar.gz
```

Copy the three (3) binaries into `/usr/bin` to overwrite the outdated versions:

```console
$ sudo cp mitmproxy /usr/bin
$ sudo cp mitmdump /usr/bin
$ sudo cp mitmweb /usr/bin
```

Verify that you have properly installed the updated version:

```console
$ mitmproxy --version
```

You should see output that looks like:
```
Mitmproxy: 7.0.4 binary
Python:    3.9.7
...
```

Copy and paste the output from that command in `submission.txt` as your response to Question 4.

HTTPS connections operate on port 443. In order for our HTTPS Proxying setup to work, we will have to tell the router (Kali VM) to intercept all the traffic that it sees coming in on port 443 and redirect it to MITM Proxy so that it can work its magic. We will use `iptables` to do this redirection. 

The syntax of `iptables` is, well, fun, and you can [research](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo) it on your own, if you like. However, I have provided you a script that will do the necessary configuration: `configure_as_mitm_proxy.sh` in this class' `git` repo under the `helpers/network` directory.

Besides configuring `iptables` properly, the helper script will also launch MITM Proxy using `mitmroxy`.

```console
$ sudo ./configure_as_mitm_proxy.sh
```

Your screen should look something like the image below.

![The ncurses UI for MITM Proxy.](./images/mitmproxyrunning.png)

Unfortunately, that's not quite all that we need to do. Fortunately, the final step is automated and already done for you in the `configure_as_mitm_proxy.sh` helper script. Nevertheless, you need to understand what is going on even if you don't need to do anything as a result. (_Note_: The last sentence is a lie; read on to find out why!)

We glossed over one important detail earlier when discussing the HTTPS Proxying configuration. While MITM Proxy is able to see the decrypted contents of the (heretofore) secure HTTPS connection between client and server, anything snooping the network (i.e., Wireshark!!) cannot. Why? Because the network transmissions (the only thing that a network snoop *can* see, after all) that MITM Proxying makes between itself and the real web server and itself and the client are both pairwise secure. All we gained with our HTTPS Proxying setup is the ability for MITM Proxy to see the decrypted contents of the connection.

MITM Proxy offers a cool piece of functionality that allows it to interact with Wireshark so that Wireshark can decrypt the packets that it snoops from the network. If properly configured, MITM Proxy will log all the [session keys](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-a-session-key/) that it generates. 

In turn, we can configure Wireshark to read that log file and (in real time, mind you!) use the contents of the log file (i.e., session keys) to decrypt the packets that it captures from the network. 

Let's do that now. Wait!! Didn't I just say that we didn't have to do anything else? Yes, but I lied. 

In Wireshark, open up the Preferences (shown in red in the figure below).

![Open the Wireshark Preferences.](./images/kaliwiresharkpreferences.png)

Next, click on Protocols and find the TLS protocol settings. You should see a screen that looks like the one in the image below.

![Wireshark TLS protocol configuration preferences.](./images/kaliwiresharkpreferencestlspng.png)

Click on the `Browse` button under the `(Pre)-Master-Secret log filename` box. Browse to `/home/kali/` and select `keyfile.txt`. This is the name and location of the file that MITM Proxy is generating -- that location and name combination is configured in `configure_as_mitm_proxy.sh` and you can customize it if you like. Press `OK`. Now that you have completed this step, you will *have to* restart Wireshark. 

And now, I promise this time!, the HTTPS Proxying setup is configured! Congratulations!!

### Step 4: Configuring the Analysis VM

Remember that we will also need to tell the client about our setup, too, so that it trusts the secrets offered by the MITM Proxy. The good news is that `mitmproxy` makes this relatively straightforward.

On the analysis VM, open up Firefox and browse to `mitm.it`. If your server setup is correct, you will see something that looks like the image below:

![The webpage displayed for the `mitm.it` URL when MITM Proxy is correctly configured.](./images/ubuntumitmwebsite.png)

Follow the installation instructions for *both* "Linux" and "Firefox". Without following the instructions for *both* configurations, you will not be able to perform the analysis!

### Step 5: Final Countdown

We have all the configuration done that we need to for our analysis. Let's do a final test to make sure that everything is set to rock and roll.

We will again use `cnn.com` as an example and run two tests. Before starting the tests, make sure that Wireshark is running on the Kali VM and (re)apply the filter for HTTP. This time, though, let's make our filter a little more broad by including all the versions of HTTP: 1, 2 *and* 3. In Wireshark, these protocol identifiers are `http`, `http2` and `http3`, respectively. Combine that information with your knowledge of the [Wireshark filter syntax](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection.html) to write an effective display filter so that you only see HTTP traffic, no matter which version of the protocol is used. Record the display filter that you applied as the answer to Question 5 in `submission.txt`. 

The first test will be run through the web browser. This test will ensure that we have properly installed the MITM Proxy impostor Certificate Authority in the browser. (Re)Open Firefox and connect to `cnn.com`. By connecting to `cnn.com` in Firefox, you should see many HTTP packets being displayed in Wireshark. Choose a packet and describe its contents (what was the resource accessed? what was the HTTP method? what was the status code?). Record your description in `submission.txt` under Question 6.

The second test will be run through `wget`. This test will ensure that we installed the MITM Proxy impostor Certificate Authority successfully in the operating system. 

```
$ wget http://www.cnn.com
```

As a result of this `wget` command, you should see two HTTP messages in Wireshark. One of the cookies that `cnn.com` sets in your web browser helps the website determine your geographic location. Look for the `geoData` value in the HTTP headers and record its contents as your response to Question 7 in `submission.txt`. You can see those HTTP headers in Wireshark.

### Step 6: `secretsearcher` Analysis

As a result of the preceding hard work and configuration, you should be able to execute the `secretsearcher` malware and answer the two outstanding questions posed in the beginning of this Mini Assignment:

1. What is the search engine that `secretsearcher` uses?
2. What is the query that `secretsearcher` issues?

Record your response to those two questions under Question 8 in `submission.txt`. 

### Conclusion

I hope that you had fun on this quest and enjoyed the hunt. Please leave feedback about this Mini Assignment under Question 9 in `submission.txt` -- if you do not leave feedback, you will not get credit!
